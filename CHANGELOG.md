# 0.1.0

First release, of ES|QL Query builder for Ruby.

This library is in active development and the final API hasn't been completed yet. If you have any feedback on the current API or general usage, please don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/elastic/esql-ruby/issues).

Check out the [README](./README.md) for available functions and examples. If you [clone the code](https://github.com/elastic/esql-ruby/), you can also generate the reference documentation with YARD by running `rake yard` in the root directory. This will create a `doc` directory, open `doc/index.html` in a web browser to read the docs.
