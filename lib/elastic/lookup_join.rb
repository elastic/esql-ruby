module Elastic
  # +LOOKUP JOIN+ enables you to add data from another index, AKA a 'lookup' index, to your ES|QL
  # query results, simplifying data enrichment and analysis workflows.
  # @see https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/commands/processing-commands#esql-lookup-join
  module LookupJoin
    # @param [String] lookup_index The name of the lookup index. This must be a specific index
    #                              name - wildcards, aliases, and remote cluster references are not
    #                              supported. Indices used for lookups must be configured with the
    #                              lookup index mode.
    # @param [String] field_name The field to join on. This field must exist in both your current
    #                            query results and in the lookup index. If the field contains
    #                            multi-valued entries, those entries will not match anything (the
    #                            added fields will contain null for those rows).
    #
    # @example
    #   Elastic::ESQL.from('sample_data').lookup_join('threat_list', 'source.IP')
    #   Elastic::ESQL.from('system_metrics')
    #                .lookup_join('host_inventory', 'host.name')
    #                .lookup_join('ownerships', 'host.name').query
    #   => FROM system_metrics | LOOKUP JOIN host_inventory ON host.name | LOOKUP JOIN ownerships ON host.name
    #
    def lookup_join!(lookup_index, field_name)
      @lookup_joins << { lookup_index.to_sym => field_name }
      self
    end

    def lookup_join(lookup_index, field_name)
      method_copy(:lookup_join, lookup_index, field_name)
